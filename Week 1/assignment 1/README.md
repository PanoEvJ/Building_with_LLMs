# <h1 align="center" id="heading">Fine-tuning a Simple Classifier with TensorFlow!</h1>

This week we'll be fine-tuning [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01108.pdf) on the [20 Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) dataset.

### Objectives 🔍

- [ ] Data Preparation
- [ ] Fine-tuning A Model for Text Classification With Hugging Face's Transformers 🤗 

### Notebook 📓

We'll be working out of this notebook for this assignment: [Building a Simple Classifier](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eTLNfx5scJ2kN-tkv1rwnnOTvsTCee84?usp=sharing)

### PreReqs ⚠️:

- You'll want to ensure you're in a GPU runtime in Colab - please follow this guide if you're unsure how to do so: [Making the Most of Your Colab Subscription](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/pro.ipynb)
- You'll also want to make sure you've set-up a Hugging Face account, and have generate a "WRITE" access token. 

### Results 💯:

At the end of this assignment, you should have a fine-tuned classifier on the Hugging Face Model Hub!

### Example:

[Here](https://huggingface.co/FourthBrainGenAI/distilbert_classifier_newsgroups) is an example of a completed assignment.
